Design
---------
1)product -Vehicle
	properties
		=>Engine
		=>Wheels
		=>Seats
		=>VehicleType
		-------->it should have the setters only.
2)VehicleBuilder --->interface
		=>setEngine(String engine);
		=>setWheels(int wheels);
		=>setSeats(int seats);
		=>setVehicleType(String vehicleType);

				=>here each builder should implement the Vehicle Builder.
					=>CarBuilder return Vehicle Named car.
						=>it will contain the method overrided from the VehicleBuilder.
						=>every over rided method should return this Builder.
						=>finally we have build method which will return the build object.
						 here it is returning expected object so we have to intiate the
						 object in noArgs Constructor.(think if we pass no args constructor
						  how we can initiate the object)
					=>BikeBuilder return Vehicle Named Bike.
					=>LorryBuilder Vehicle Named Lorry.

3)Director
	=>it having method named construct(can give the any name) which will construct the object.


4)Client code
		=>here we will create the new object of Director which having constructor can allow only one argument which is Builder.
		=>so before creating Director object we should create the BuilderObject.
		=>then we by using director object we can call the construct method over
		there then we can build the vehichle based on the
		builder we provided.
